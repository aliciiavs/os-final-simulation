OS Final Project

This program entails the simulation of a three-day music festival. Boombastic Festival happens in different locations around Spain but our simulation covers the Asturias 2022 festival.

In order to run this simulation, the steps to be taken are the following:
1 - First run the 'Create SQL DB.py' adding your MySQL password in order to create the boombastic database.
2 - Run the 'Create SQL Tables.py' adding your MySQL password in order to create the necessary tables.
3 - Run the 'Populate Attendee Names.py.py' adding your MySQL password in order to populate the attendee_names table.
4 - Run the 'Boombastic Simulation.py' to run the simulation and finish for the simulation to run.
5 - Run the 'Populate Snapshots Table.py' to populate the snapshots table which summarizes how many people in each place every 6 minutes.
6 - Do analysis on the data. Some of our suggested queries can be found on the 'SQL Queries.sql' file.
